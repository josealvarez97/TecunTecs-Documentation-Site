# Ordinary Differential Equations

An Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) is nothing more than a differential equation with one independent variable.
In Physics, that is often time, but it can be anything else.

## Solving Ordinary Differential Equations

The quintessential (numerical) method for solving an ODE is Euler's method. Not coincidentally, it also happens to be the
most intuitive one. Let us illustrate this with the most "ordinary" ODE, a 1st-order ODE:

$$
\frac{dx}{dt} = f(t,x)
$$

Few things are nicer than a rate of change that depends upon the independent variable $t$ and the unkown function $x(t)$ (the dependent variable). If you have one single value of the function at a given time, you can calcullate how the function $x(t)$ will change at that instant. Recalling that an integral is nothing more than an accumulation of very small changes, if you do this a lot of times, you will get a good idea of the behavior of the unknown function $x(t)$.

$$
\int_a^b x'(t)dt \approx \left[ \frac{x_1 - x_0}{\Delta t} + \frac{x_2 - x_1}{\Delta t} + \cdot \cdot \cdot + \frac{x_n - x_{n-1}}{\Delta t} \right] \Delta t
$$

The previous expression is a good opportunity to appreciate the intuition behind the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, for $x(b) - x(a)$ certainly corresponds to $x_n - x_0$.

The insight, however, from the perspective of numerical methods, comes from realizing that if you don't know $x_n$, you can "get to it" by applying an algorithm like the one we learned in the previous section.
