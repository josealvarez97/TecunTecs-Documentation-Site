# Computing Integrals

Few things are easier than a rate of change that depends upon the independent variable:

$$
\frac{dx}{dt} = f(t)
$$

You would compute $x(t)$ with an algorithm such as the midpoint method or trapezoidal rule.
Just start with a given value of
$t_0$, calculate the (instantaneous) rate of change $f(t_0)$, and multiply by a small amount of change $\Delta t$.

Repeat the process enough times such that $t_n=t_{n-1}+\Delta t$, and you
will have approximated $x(t_n)$, an accumulation of small changes.
