# Lid Driven Cavity Flow

Any physics simulation problem that is defined by differential equations demands information about the domain of the problem and its governing equations or boundary conditions.

In the case of Physics Informed Neural Networks, the solvers will sample the points in the geometry into sub-sampled points on the boundaries (to satisfy the boundary conditions), and interior region points to minimize the loss function.

## Case Setup

### What do you need?

- The geometry (or "point cloud")
  - Nvidia Modulus' Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) module
  - STL module
  - **Raw point cloud data from CSV file**/numpy arrays.
- The boundary conditions
- The network information

## That's (almost) it!

With all of the previous information, we can go ahead and use a solver to obtain the solution. TecunTecs enters the picture by providing you with a range of different options integrated into the same cloud-service, whether that's traditional numerical methods or Physics Informed Neural Networks.

TecunTecs is powered by Nvidia's powerful Modulus library. In the following interface, you can try solving the LDC many types of geometry:

2D:

- Rectangle
- Circle
- Triangle
- Infinite channel
- Line

3D:

- Sphere
- Constructive
- Cuboid
- Infinite channel
- Plane
- Cylinder
- Torus
- Tetrahedron
- Triangular prism

In the future, we will add support to construct more complex geometries based on these primitives by performing operations like add, subtract, and intersect.
