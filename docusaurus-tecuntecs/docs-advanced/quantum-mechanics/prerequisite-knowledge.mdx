# Pre-requisite Knowledge

#### Grant Sanderson on "not being gifted enough"

#### The case for taking pre-requisite knowledge seriously (but fearlessly)

When it comes to mathematics (and quantum mechanics has a lot of it), 
it is common currency to hold the belief that some gifted people simply "get it" 
faster than others. But does this belief actually hold true to reality? 
**For the most part, at least, it seems that background is the real dealbraker.**

:::tip Understand the pre-requisites

Quantum mechanics is not really that hard; **it just has a 
lot of pre-requisite knowledge.** If the pre-requisite knowledge is practiced 
and learned at the right pace at the right 
time, anyone can understand, master, and apply the theory.

:::tip

:::warning Do not overlook the pre-requisites

The same is true for the opposite scenario: **without the right pre-requisite 
knowledge, the most seemingly straightforward lecture on quantum mechanics will
be as strange as an unfamiliar alphabet and as hard as trying to read it**. 
But to blame is not the lack of talent, but the pedagogy 
(whether self-taught or not).

:::warning

## Physics background

Contrary to the way that quantum mechanics is usually taught, it is possible 
to understand the theory without most of the math. 
The mathematical formulation of the theory is not the same as the theory, 
but a representation of it.
With enough words and good prose, it should be possible explain quantum mechanics
with verbal logic.

It is also a good idea explain the history of the 
subject.
By understanding how it came about, we gain a lot of insight into the theory that
we don't get if we start with the modern mathematical formulation.

This below is still the mathematical formulation! (but at least still focused
on the concepts and not on the mathematical jargon)

"It is easy to find a system in which the SE cannot be solved analytically" (
    This is where a solution like TecunTecs comes in)
    Even best computers cannot handle systems that are larger than a few dozens
    atoms. Example: Helium atom.

"The Schrodinger Equation tells you how the quantum state changes with respect
to time based on its energy"

What is a quantum system?


:::info What are examples of quantum systems?

- If you are interested in how a hydrogen atom behaves, then your quantum 
system is that hydrogen atom (in addition to any extra necessary information
such as the position and what's happening in its surroundings).
- If you place the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field, then your quantum system 
is that hydrogen atom in the magnetic field.
- If you look deeper at the hydrogen atom, the subatomic particles such as the
electron, neutron, proton, ane even photon may constitute your quantum system.

:::info What is a quantum state? 

A quantum state is the mathematical description of our quantum system, i.e.,
it's an expression that "stores" as much information as we know about the
quantum system.

**Indeed, the quantum state object holds everything about the state of 
the quantum system!**

"The wave function is all the mathematical information we know about our system."

"Operators are mathematical entities that correspond to making a measurement in real life"

## Mathematical background

:::note First Postulate of Quantum Mechanics

The state of a physical system is characterized by a **state vector** that belongs
to a complex vector space $\mathbf{V}$, called the **state space** of the system.

:::

The first postulate from quantum mechanics encourages you to get a refresher on
the basic properties of vector spaces from linear algebra.

For a more comprehensive study on vector spaces and the operations we can perform
on them, watch the following lectures by Prof. Gilbert Strang:

#### Column spaces (i.e., the vector space generated by the columns of a matrix)

#### Independence, basis, and dimension

> "The basis is a bunch of vectors"

> "The dimension is how many vectors"

Other important operations we can perform on vector spaces are the scalar or "dot" product.

:::note Second Postulate of Quantum Mechanics

A physical quantity $\mathcal{A}$ is described by an operator $\mathcal{\hat{A}}$
acting on the state space $\mathcal{V}$, and this operator is an observable.

:::

Operators are the mathematical objects that allow us to describe physical quantities
in quantum mechanics.
