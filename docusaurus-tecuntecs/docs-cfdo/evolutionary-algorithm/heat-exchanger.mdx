# Heat Exchanger

Notes:

A heat exchanger configuration is considered using the coupled solution of the flow/heat transfer processes.

The aim of the procedure is to find the **positions of the tubes** most favorable to simultaneously **maximize heat exchange** while obtaining a **minimum pressure loss**.

An Evolutioanry Algorithm (EA) is applied to find the optimal configurations.

The computer package Opal is used to perform the optimization process.

The EA relies on a large number of simulations which may result in a considerable computational effort.

The procedure can be performed in parallel on a Linux PC-cluster to reduce user waiting time.

The main goal of this work is to achieve cost-efficient design optimization problems involving complex flows with heat transfer or chemical reactions using Computational Fluid Dynamcis (CFD) codes for practical configurations, while keeping reasonable computing times.

They can be used for multi-objective multi-parameter problems.

They have been successfully tested in many practical
cases, for example for design shape optimization in the aerospace
[1, 24, 54, 55, 64] and automotive industry [61].

The use of a fully automatic
EA coupled with CFD for a multi-objective problem still remains limited by
the computing time and is up to now far from being a practical tool for all
engineering applications.
