# CFD-based Optimization

The first applications of optimization in fluid dynamics were found in aeronatuical problems. Problems of this type involve the basic equations of fluid dynamics and add a lot of value.

Today, there are a variety of specific engineering applications for CFD-O:

- Aerospace
- Turbomachines
- Automotive
- Heat transfer
- Paper making

While simple CFD problems can be solved within seconds on a standard PC; high-end CFD problems can require weeks of computing times and Terabytes (1 TB=1000 GB) of memory on supercomputers.

Researchers have argued that "_CFD-O is possible when the duration of a single CFD computation does not exceed a few hours at most._" This assumption can be challenged by the advent of accessible high-performance parallel computing. If we line up 30 processors, it may be possible to bring the duration of one single evaluation in a complex problem from 1 day down to 1 hour.
