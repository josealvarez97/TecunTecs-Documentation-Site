# TecunTecs Intro

Any software library is an **Application Programming Interface (API)**. It abstracts a set of programming tasks as a set of short commands. 
The **TecunTecs API** is like any other software library, but on the cloud.

We believe there exists a gap between the technological stack currently used to
solve **applied engineering problems** and the technological potential 
to implement a **unified suite of features** to empower the analysis by making it 
more interactive, accessible, and uncomplicated. 


**TecunTecs Cloud Platform** translates the knowledge of the experts in the 
field of **Computational Engineering** into a
powerful and scalable **easy-to-use solution**.
