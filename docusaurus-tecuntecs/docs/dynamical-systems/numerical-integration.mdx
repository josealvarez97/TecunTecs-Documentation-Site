# Numerical Integration

Few things are easier than a rate of change that depends upon the independent 
variable. In a way (every way), this is any–single variable–function that you have set sail to 
integrate.

$$
\frac{dx}{dt}=f(t) \Rightarrow \int \frac{dx}{dt} dx=x(t)
$$

You would compute the previous with an algorithm such as the midpoint method 
or trapezoidal rule. Just start with a given value of $t$, calculate $f(t)$, 
and multiply by a small amount of change $x$.

import Calculator from '../../src/components/Calculator/Calculator'
import {integrate, paramInfo, ResultContainer} from './numerical-integration.js';


<Calculator 
    title="Calculator" 
    onCalculate={integrate} 
    paramInfo={paramInfo} 
    resultComponent={ResultContainer} 
/>
