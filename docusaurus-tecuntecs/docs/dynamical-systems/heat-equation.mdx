# Heat Equation

The one dimensional heat equation is

$$
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} (x,t) = \alpha \frac{\partial ^2 T}{\partial x^2} (x,t)
$$

In other words, the rate of change of the temperature ($T$) with 
respect to time ($t$) is proportional to the rate of change, of the rate of 
change, of the temperature with respect to the position ($x$). This means that the rate of heat transfer
is the greatest at those points where the temperature differs the most from 
the surrounding areas.

## Boundary Conditions and Initial Conditions

Solution to the Heat Equation requires specification of boundary conditions at
$x = 0$ and $x = x_{max}=L$, and initial conditions at $t = 0$. 

For simplicity, let us consider fixed (Dirichlet) boundary conditions

$$
T(0, t) = T_0
$$

$$
T(L, t) = T_{L}
$$

$$
T(x, 0) = f_0(x)
$$

We could also potentially consider rates of change as 
(Neumann) boundary conditions if we wanted to.

## Schemes for the Heat Equation

Applying the finite-difference method to a differential equation 
involves nothing more than replacing all derivatives with difference formulas.

### Forward time, centered space

:::caution

The notation $T_n(i)$ means the (approximated) value of the temperature at the temporal step $n$, position $i$. 

:::

_Forward time, centered space_ **(FTCS)** means that we will use a forward difference 
approximation for the time derivative, and a centered difference approximation 
for the second space derivative.

$$
\frac{T_{n+1}(i) - T_{n}(i)} {\Delta t} = \alpha \frac{T_n(i-1) - 2 T_n(i) + T_n(i+1)}{\Delta x^2}
$$

Once we have a version of the Heat Equation that is "discretized," we can proceed to solve for the 
term(s) of interest; in this case, we would solve for $T_{n+1}(i)$.

$$
T_{n+1}(i) = T_{n}(i) + \frac{\alpha \Delta t}{\Delta x^2} (T_n(i-1) - 2 T_n(i) + T_n(i+1))
$$

**Voil√†!** Now we have a temporal discretization that gives us the temperature at the next temporal 
step $n+1$ based on values we know at the temporal step $n$.
