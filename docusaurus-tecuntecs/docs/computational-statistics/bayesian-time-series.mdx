# Bayesian Time Series

:::info What is "cross-sectional" data?

It's a type of data collected by observing many subjects at one point in time.

:::

:::info What is "time series" data?

It's a series of data points indexed in time order.

:::tip What are examples of time-series cross-sectional data?

Classical examples of time-series cross-sectional data are the rate of 
unemployment, percentage of obesity, 
or GDP of a country indexed by year.

## A Bayesian Alternative to the Synthetic Control Method

Pang et al. (2021) published an R package for Bayesian causal inference with 
time-series cross-sectional data. What this means is that they have come up 
with a Bayesian alternative to the popular
synthetic control method for comparative case studies.

Pang et al. (2021) are still developing the `bpCausal` R package, 
but the TecunTecs API aims to provide you with an stable interface that
you can easily leverage on any programming language of your choice.

### What do you need to get started with time-series cross-sectional data analaysis?

Getting started with time-series data analysis is not as hard as most research
papers make it seem. You really just need the right type of data, and a 
machine that will deliver you the results which you have to interpret later. (Usually
the hardest part is to develop the methods that the machine will use, but researchers
are good at that and our job at TecunTecs is to make it easy to use them.)

Here's a list of the requirements your time-series data must satistfy: 

* **Do you have a time-series, i.e., a list of data points indexed by time?** Usually
this is represented as the rows in a data matrix, with one column indexing the 
corresponding point in time. It is also common practice to have another column
representing a unique ID for every unit.
* **Is your data cross-sectional? In other words, are you "tracking" at least one 
specific variable of a large population throughout time (e.g., GDP of a country)?**
This should be the variable(s) for which you aim to estimate the (average) causal effect of 
the treatment on the treated (ATT). These are also called the "outcome variables."
* **Do you have a treatment indicator for your units?** Usually this is one column of 
the data matrix allowing two possible values, one for the control units and other 
for the treated units.
* **Have you identified the relevant covariates?** Make sure you're not comparing apples
to bananas. For example, if you want to estimate the effect of a specific 
new tax regulation on GDP, 
you probably should be careful about comparing the 
United States to Guatemala (or many countries like Guatemala and viceversa),
at least directly. 
Perhaps you would like to adjust by other things such
as the rate of crime, education levels, wealth, population size, etc. 
A covariate is any potentially
confounding variable you want to control for. 
They are usually represented as a set of 
columns in your data matrix.

:::note what's the gist of the popular synthetic control method?

What would you do if you want to estimate the effect of 
reunification on West Germany? 
This is a tough question because we don't get to see a parallel 
universe in which the Berlin Wall never fell down. Abadie et al. (2015)
studied the 
problem by producing a "synthetic" West Germany, which is a weighted average
of a list of neighboring countries produced based on the similarity 
of their covariates to West Germany.

:::

If you answered positively to the previous questions, your data should be mostly
ready for time-series cross-sectional analysis. There may be other parameters
that different methodologies may require when you input everything into the 
"machine," but chances are you don't need to take more real-world measurements.

## How to use bpCausal?

`bpCausal` is the R package developed by Pang et al. (2021). The TecunTecs API 
offers an easy-to-use interface to leverage the power of this package more easily.
Thus, the minimum theoretical concepts you must know are necessarily the same.

`bpCausal` is based on a potentially ugly-looking mathematical model, but 
it really isn't as bad as it seems. The following linear model describes
the parameters used by `bpCausal`:

$$
y_{it} = \delta_{it} D_{it} + X_{it}^{\prime}\beta + Z_{it}^{\prime}\alpha_i 
+ A_{it}^{\prime}\Xi_t + \Gamma_i^{\prime}f_t + \varepsilon_{it}
$$

It is just another linear model. What is important is to understand what the 
factors mean.

- **First term:** ($D_{it}$) is just the binary treatment indicator. As we said, 
this should be a column in your data matrix allowing only two possible values.
($\delta_{it}$) is more interesting; it represents the heterogeneous treatment 
effect. 
- **Second, third, and fourth term:** ($X_{it}$), ($Z_{it}$) and ($A_{it}$) are 
vectors of covariates that have constant, unit-level random and time-level 
random effects on the outcome, respectively. 
Pang et al. (2021) assume the random effects to have zero mean, and note that there 
can be overlapping among ($X_{it}$), ($Z_{it}$) and ($A_{it}$) 
if some covarites have both constant and random effects.
- **Fifth term:**
- **Sixth term:** This is just a formality, the unknown error term $\epsilon_{it}$. 
You obviously 
don't know this and that's the whole point. Get rid of this guy and place the $\approx$
symbol instead of $=$, that is what you're really doing.

We welcome you to review the paper by Pang et al. (2021) for more information 
about these parameters.

The rest of the parameters you need to know to use `bpCausal` are easier.
Please refer to the `bpCausal` GitHub repository by Pang et al. (2021)
