# Numerical Integration

Few things are easier than a rate of change that depends upon the independent 
variable. In a way (every way), this is any–single variable–function that you have set sail to 
integrate.

$$
\frac{dx}{dt}=f(t) \Rightarrow \int \frac{dx}{dt} dx=x(t)
$$

You would compute the previous with an algorithm such as the midpoint method 
or trapezoidal rule. Just start with a given value of $t$, calculate $f(t)$, 
and multiply by a small amount of change $x$.
