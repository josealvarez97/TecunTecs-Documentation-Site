# Quantum-inspired Optimization (QIO)

Quantum-inspired Optimization (QIO) is not really quantum computing, but it will be. 
QIO might be said to be the future input format of certain types of quantum computers.
This input format is called _Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization_ (QUBO), 
a relatively new approach to optimization with many promising applications.

## Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)

Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) has vast applications from 
finance and economics to machine learning. Oftentimes, applications appear 
naturally in the form of QUBO, but in many cases, important constrained nonlinear 
binary models have been re-cast into the form of QUBO problems (Kochenberger et al., 2014, p. 59). 

Mathematical models applicable across different fields include 

* Quadratic Assignment Problems; 
* Capital Budgeting Problems; 
* Multiple Knapsack Problems; 
* Task Allocation Problems (distributed computer systems); 
* Maximum Diversity Problems; 
* P-Median Problems; 
* Asymmetric Assignment Problems; 
* Symmetric Assignment Problems; 
* Side Constrained Assignment Problems; 
* Quadratic Knapsack Problems; 
* Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs); 
* Discrete Tomography Problems; 
* Set Partitioning Problems; 
* Set Packing Problems; 
* Warehouse Location Problems; 
* Maximum Clique Problems; 
* Maximum Independent Set Problems; 
* Maximum Cut Problems; 
* Graph Coloring Problems; 
* Number Partitioning Problems; 
* Linear Ordering Problems; 
* Clique Partitioning Problems; 
* and SAT problems (Glover & Konchenberger, 2006, p. 113).

According to Glover et al. (2018), “Through special reformulation techniques that are easy to apply, 
the power of QUBO solvers can be used to efficiently solve many important problems once they are put 
into the QUBO framework.”

### Structure of a Binary Optimization Problem

The problem is formally expressed as:

$$
\min_x x^T Qx
$$
$$
\text{s.t.    } x_i \in \{-1,1\}
$$

where $Q$ is a symmetric $n \times n$ matrix.

Because we can model the linear constraints using quadratic equations, we can write the equivalent polynomial formulation:

$$
\min_x x^T Qx
$$
$$
\text{s.t.    } x_i^2 = 1
$$

In other words, $x$ is a vector of binary decision variables to 
optimize and $Q$ is a square matrix of constants that defines the 
problem.

## Examples

### Number Partitioning Problem (NPP)

The number partitioning problem is to divide a given set of integers 
into a collection of subsets, so that the sum of the numbers in each 
subset are as nearly equal as possible. It is NP-complete.

#### Complete Anytime Algorithms for NPP

(Korf, 1998, p. 182) presented a case study of a different approach 
to algorithm design. He starts with the best polynomial-time 
approximation algorithm for a problem. The idea is to find the 
approximate solution based on a heuristic first, and let the algorithm 
continue to run to find only better solutions. He claims that, 
eventually, it should find and verify the optimal solution.

#### Quantum-inspired Approach to NPP

Alidaee et al. (2005) recast the problem as a QUBO problem. Their approach accommodates both the two-subset partition case as well as the more general case of multiple subsets. The novelty lies in the fact of illustrating a common formulation for a variety of NPP problems that can be solved by recently developed metaheuristic methods.
